## Project Summary

Friend-ly is a student-centered social media app designed to help students, particularly commuters and first-years at the University of Washington, build meaningful, lasting friendships based on shared interests. The app allows students to find matches based on their hobbies, classes, and posts, fostering authentic connections and social engagement.

## Problem Statement

Many students struggle to form lasting friendships, especially those who spend less time on campus. Friend-ly addresses this by connecting students with others who share similar interests, encouraging them to engage and form real connections beyond initial, surface-level interactions.

## Features

### MVP (P0)

-   **User Authentication**: Integrates UW NetID API to authenticate users and restrict access to UW students only.

-   **Interest-Based Matching System**: Users can enter their interests and preferences, and the app calculates similarity ratings between students to suggest potential friends.

-   **Chat Feature**: Users can chat with friends they've connected with. Messages persist even after app restarts.

### Post-MVP (P1/P2)

-   **Geolocation**: Displays the locations of friends (with privacy controls to hide unconnected usersâ€™ details).

-   **Music API Integration**: Matches users based on similar music tastes using a potential Spotify API integration.

-   **Analytics Page**: Provides users with insights on their interactions and friendships made within the app.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Users create an account using their UW NetID.
2. **Profile Setup**: Users input their interests, hobbies, and classes, adding a profile picture and description.
3. **Matching**: The app uses an algorithm to match users based on shared interests and preferences.
4. **Chat & Interaction**: Users can follow, message, and engage with their matches, building deeper connections over time.
5. **Future Features**: Post-MVP features like geolocation and music-based matching will enhance the experience.
